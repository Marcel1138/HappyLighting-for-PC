Simple Triones LED control 


Modules: 
~$ sudo pip install trionesControl
~$ sudo pip install tk


To control your LED, you need the MAC address of the LED.

You find the macwith this command
"$ sudo hcitool lescan"

I'll be honest, so far you can only turn the lamp on and off and change the colors. 
This is because Triones doesn't have proper documentation.
